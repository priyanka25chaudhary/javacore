/*An exception is first thrown from the top of the stack 
 * and if it is not caught, it drops down the call stack to the previous method. 
 * If not caught there, the exception again drops down to the previous method, 
 * and so on until they are caught or until they reach the very bottom of the call stack. 
 * This is called exception propagation.

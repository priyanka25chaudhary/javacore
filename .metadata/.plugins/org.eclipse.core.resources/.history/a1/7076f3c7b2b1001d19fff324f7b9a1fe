/*Abstract class:
 * 
 * An abstract class must be declared with an abstract keyword.
It can have abstract and non-abstract methods.
It cannot be instantiated ie;(creating an object of the class is called instantiation)
It can have constructors and static methods also.
It can have final methods which will force the subclass not to change the body of the method.
